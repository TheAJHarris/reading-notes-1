# Code 201 Reading Notes

## **Jason Quaglia**

I'm a 26 year old student at _CodeFellows_. I live in downtown Seattle with my girlfriend and our dog Bentley. Some of the things I like to do in my free time are gaming, hiking, camping, snowboarding, and of course I love tinkering with computers and technology. I'm hoping to become a software engineer to better myself and my life. I've always loved computers and technology and hope to bring some of that passion into a career. Hopefully, with the help of _CodeFellows_ I can make that come to fruition. This is my reading notes on CSS, HTML, and JavaScript from the code 201 course. I will be continually updating this page throughout the 201 class.
